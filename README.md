Welcome to the Coffee House!

This project is a simple command-line interface for a coffee shop. It allows customers to place an order, and calculates the total bill. But be warned, we have some special rules for certain customers...

How to Use
Run the script and follow the prompts.

If you're Loki, don't even think about trying to come in.
If you're Ben or Yog, be prepared to answer some questions about your moral character.
Choose from the menu options: Coffee, Tea, Black Tea, Black Coffee, or Cold Coffee.
